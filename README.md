# first-project

It's my first ever Github project which involves - 
      1. Data cleaning of IPL Dataset forked from Kaggle Datasheet Resource Section.
      2. Analysing the Data upon various criterion like toss_decisions , favorite_venues , matches_won , season_wise.
      3. Further visualising the data and the analysed data.
      

Go checkout the code and can fork it and further apply changes.
